This repository contains materials related to my poster and corresponding proceedings paper ``Does at-issueness predict projection? It's Complicated!" presented at North East Linguistic Society (NELS) 49.

The stimuli used in the experiment are available in a csv file, as well as in a pdf file with a bit more description:

*QP1Stim.csv contains the following columns:
- List: the presentation list to which the stimulus was assigned
- ID: the ID to identify the stimuli that share the same target sentence
- Item: another ID to differentiate between stimuli sharing the same target sentence but corresponding to different experimental conditions
- Condition: the experimental condition (Polar Question context or Why-Question context)
- Predicate: the clause-embedding predicate
- Name1: the matrix subject's name 
- Name2: the complement clause subject's name
- Context: 2 sentences of context preceding the target sentence, the second of which is the Why- or Polar Question.
- Target: the target sentence
- Prompt: the clause used to form the response question, i.e., is SPEAKER certain that PROMPT?
- Denial: the 3rd speaker's utterance used in the at-issueness block of the experiment. 

*QPStim.pdf: contains the same information as QP1Stim.csv but as a pdf, and also provides a bit more description.
